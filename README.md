# BLENDER-camp 
Camp made in blender for Bara's birthday

Blendr CAMP (witchit style) made me thing abou idea that we could sell part of nature to people throught websites. Small part of the world each of them will be uniq and 3D printed. We will be able provide plain 3D object that people could color by them selfs or we will paint it for them.
They will be able to make dicision about width, lenght, hight and for example period of year and element that would be critical for the object for exaple type of forrest or presents of river.
